## Text Classification

Ask the AI to provide guidance on text classification tasks:

- **Approaches:** Request the AI to suggest NLP techniques or models for text classification.
- **Preprocessing:** Instruct the AI to provide tips for text preprocessing or feature extraction.
- **Evaluation:** Ask the AI to explain evaluation metrics and techniques for text classification.

Example: _"Suggest **NLP techniques** for **multi-label text classification**."_

---

## Sentiment Analysis

Guide the AI in creating or providing insights on sentiment analysis:

- **Techniques:** Request the AI to recommend sentiment analysis models or approaches.
- **Domain Adaptation:** Instruct the AI to suggest strategies for adapting sentiment analysis to specific domains.
- **Polarity Detection:** Ask the AI to provide guidance on detecting sentiment polarity in text.

Example: _"Recommend **sentiment analysis models** for **social media comments**."_

---

## Named Entity Recognition

Elicit advice on named entity recognition (NER) tasks:

- **Models:** Request the AI to suggest NER models or techniques.
- **Entity Types:** Instruct the AI to provide guidance on identifying custom entity types.
- **Evaluation:** Ask the AI to explain evaluation metrics and techniques for NER.

Example: _"Suggest **named entity recognition models** for **medical text**."_

---

## Text Summarization

Ask the AI for help with text summarization tasks:

- **Approaches:** Request the AI to recommend extractive or abstractive summarization models.
- **Length Control:** Instruct the AI to generate summaries of specific lengths or degrees of compression.
- **Customization:** Ask the AI to provide guidance on customizing summarization models for specific domains.

Example: _"Generate an **abstractive summary** of the following article in **50 words**."_

---

## Text Generation

Guide the AI in generating text for various NLP applications:

- **Control:** Request the AI to generate text with specific constraints, such as tone, style, or structure.
- **Templates:** Instruct the AI to fill in blanks or complete templates with appropriate text.
- **Language:** Ask the AI to generate text in different languages or translate text between languages.

Example: _"Generate a **professional email** response using the following template."_

By applying these prompt optimization techniques, you can enhance the AI's performance in natural language processing tasks and applications.

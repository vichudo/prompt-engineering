---

## Block 1: Context

Provide background information or context to guide the AI's understanding of the prompt.

_Labels:_

- `C1`: As a beginner in...
- `C2`: Considering the current situation...
- `C3`: In the context of...

_Example:_

- `C1`: As a beginner in machine learning...

---

## Block 2: Goal

Define the objective or desired outcome of the prompt.

_Labels:_

- `G1`: I want to understand...
- `G2`: Explain how to...
- `G3`: Help me determine...

_Example:_

- `G1`: I want to understand the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning...

---

## Block 3: Constraints

Specify constraints, limitations, or preferences to focus the AI's response.

_Labels:_

- `L1`: In a concise manner...
- `L2`: Provide three examples...
- `L3`: Using only open-source tools...

_Example:_

- `L1`: In a concise manner...

---

## Block 4: Output Format

Request the AI to generate the response in a specific format or structure.

_Labels:_

- `O1`: as a list...
- `O2`: in a step-by-step process...
- `O3`: as a comparison table...

_Example:_

- `O1`: as a list...

## Master Prompt Construction

Combine the selected components from each block to construct a master prompt:

_Master Prompt Example:_

`C1` + `G1` + `L1` + `O1` = "As a beginner in machine learning, I want to understand the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning in a concise manner as a list."

By using these fundamental blocks, labels, and possible sentence choices, you can create master prompts tailored to your specific requirements and optimize the AI's performance.

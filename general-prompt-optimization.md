## Asking Questions

Phrase your prompts as clear and concise questions:

- **Be specific:** Clearly define your requirements or the information you seek.
- **Use keywords:** Highlight important terms or concepts to help the AI focus on the desired topic.

Example: _"What are the **key differences** between **Python** and **JavaScript** in terms of **syntax** and **use cases**?"_

---

## Setting Context

Provide the AI with sufficient context to understand the prompt and generate accurate responses:

- **Introduce the topic:** Briefly explain the subject matter or provide background information.
- **Clarify the purpose:** State the objective or goal of the prompt.

Example: _"As a software developer learning new programming languages, I want to understand the **main advantages** of **Rust** over **C++** in terms of **performance** and **memory management**."_

---

## Constraints and Limitations

Specify constraints or limitations to guide the AI's response:

- **Define scope:** Limit the response to a specific domain, time frame, or set of resources.
- **Impose word count:** Request a response of a certain length, such as a summary or detailed explanation.

Example: _"Summarize the **history** of **artificial intelligence** from the **1950s to 2000** in **100 words**."_

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

Ask the AI to provide step-by-step instructions, guidelines, or processes:

- **Request steps:** Instruct the AI to list or describe steps, stages, or phases.
- **Specify order:** Ask the AI to provide a chronological, logical, or priority-based sequence.

Example: _"Describe the **key steps** to **deploy a machine learning model** using **TensorFlow** in a **sequential order**."_

---

## Examples

Request examples, illustrations, or analogies to clarify concepts or demonstrate applications:

- **Ask for examples:** Instruct the AI to provide real-life, hypothetical, or fictional examples.
- **Request comparisons:** Ask the AI to compare or contrast similar concepts, technologies, or practices.

Example: _"Provide an **example** of how **machine learning algorithms** can be applied to **improve user experience** in a **mobile app**."_

By using these general prompt optimization techniques, you can enhance the performance of AI language models across various topics and applications.
